# spinviz 0.0.1.0000

* Removed a duplicate `grDevices` entry from `DESCRIPTION` Imports.
* Added a `tests/testthat` suite covering `diagram_colours()`, `test_colour()`,
  and `injury_heatmap()`.
* `injury_heatmap()` no longer calls `print()` on its result before
  returning it, which previously caused the plot to render twice in
  R Markdown/Quarto documents when the call was left unassigned.
* `injury_heatmap()` now warns when values in the selected sport column
  cannot be converted to numeric, instead of silently coercing them to `NA`.
* `injury_heatmap()`'s documentation for the `palette` argument is now
  regenerated and no longer shows the stale "WIP" placeholder text.
* `injury_heatmap()`'s front/back label coordinate tables are now built
  from a single shared lookup (`label_position_lookup()`) instead of two
  hand-duplicated tables, so the views cannot silently drift apart.
* `injury_heatmap()`'s combined "both views" label table
  (`both_label_position_lookup()`) now validates its front-only/back-only
  regions against the same single source of truth
  (`view_exclusive_regions()`) used by the SVG id and per-view label
  lookups, instead of re-encoding which regions are one-sided a third
  time.
* `test_colour()` now restores the caller's `graphics::par()` settings on
  exit instead of permanently changing the plotting layout (`mfrow`).
* Fixed a documentation typo in `test_colour()` ("coloublind" ->
  "colourblind").
